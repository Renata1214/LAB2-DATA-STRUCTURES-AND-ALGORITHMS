# LAB2-DATA-STRUCTURES-AND-ALGORITHMS

In this Lab you are required to create a List using C-style mechanisms new/delete/pointers (without using STL).

## Summary of the tasks:
1. Create singly linked List of Payload elements
2. Add List methods: push_front, pop_front
3. Add List method size. It has to count its elements by iterating the List, do not
store the size as a variable.
4. Assume that Payload has a method print. Add print method (non- standard)
to List so that print is called on each element. Remember: no standard header
includes should be in your code.
5. Generate ChatGPT Solution and compare your solution to the generated one.
6. Bonus 1: Make Vector & List templates, so other types can be used.
7. Bonus 2: Make your List work with range based loop
